# Changelog - SVD2CPP Bug Fixes and Improvements

## Summary of Major Bug Fixes Performed

### 1. **Parser Robustness** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Insufficient error handling for malformed SVD files
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive try-catch blocks around all parsing operations
- **Impact**: Parser no longer crashes on invalid XML or unexpected data

### 2. **Duplicate Handling** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: No checking for duplicate peripheral/register/field names
- **Fix**: Implemented sets to track processed names and prevent duplicates
- **Impact**: Prevents duplicate C++ definitions that would cause compilation errors

### 3. **Memory Layout Validation** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: No validation of overlapping registers
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive register layout validation with warnings
- **Impact**: Detects and warns about memory layout issues

### 4. **Bit Field Validation** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Poor validation of bit field ranges and overlaps
- **Fix**: Comprehensive bit field validation including overlap detection
- **Impact**: Prevents invalid bit field definitions that could cause undefined behavior

### 5. **Integer Parsing** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Limited support for integer formats (hex, binary, octal)
- **Fix**: Enhanced `_try_parse_int()` with support for all common formats
- **Impact**: Correctly parses addresses, sizes, and values in various formats

### 6. **HTML Entity Handling** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: HTML entities in descriptions could break generated comments
- **Fix**: Added `html.unescape()` to properly decode HTML entities
- **Impact**: Clean, readable comments in generated C++ code

### 7. **C++ Keyword Conflicts** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Generated identifiers could clash with C++ keywords
- **Fix**: Added complete C++ keyword list and automatic renaming
- **Impact**: Generated code compiles without identifier conflicts

### 8. **Comment Safety** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: SVD descriptions with `*/` could break C++ comments
- **Fix**: Proper escaping of comment-closing sequences
- **Impact**: Safe, valid C++ comments regardless of input

### 9. **Size Validation** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Invalid register sizes could cause compilation issues
- **Fix**: Comprehensive size validation with reasonable limits
- **Impact**: Generated structs have valid, predictable sizes

### 10. **File Path Handling** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Poor error handling for file I/O operations
- **Fix**: Comprehensive file validation and error reporting
- **Impact**: Clear error messages for file-related issues

### 11. **Reset Value Validation** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Reset values could exceed register capacity
- **Fix**: Validation and truncation of reset values to register size
- **Impact**: Prevents overflow and ensures valid reset values

### 12. **Access Type Validation** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: No validation of access types from SVD
- **Fix**: Whitelist of valid access types with defaults
- **Impact**: Consistent, valid access specifications

### 13. **Reserved Area Handling** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Gaps between registers not properly handled
- **Fix**: Automatic insertion of reserved padding areas
- **Impact**: Accurate memory layout representation

### 14. **Type Safety** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Inconsistent integer types for different register sizes
- **Fix**: Proper type selection based on register bit width
- **Impact**: Type-safe code generation for all register sizes

### 15. **Static Assertions** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: No compile-time size validation
- **Fix**: Added static_assert statements for size verification
- **Impact**: Compile-time detection of size mismatches

## Version Information

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Release Date**: May 18, 2025  
**Compatibility**: Python 3.6+  
**Dependencies**: Standard library only  

## Migration Notes

This version includes breaking changes from the initial implementation:
- More strict validation may reject previously accepted invalid SVD files
- Generated C++ code structure improved but may require minor updates to existing projects
- Error reporting is more detailed but may affect automated tools expecting specific formats

## Future Roadmap

Planned features for future releases:
- Register arrays support
- Enumerated values for bit fields
- Custom templates for code generation
- Multiple output formats (JSON, YAML)
- Interrupt vector generation
- Peripheral inheritance and derivation
