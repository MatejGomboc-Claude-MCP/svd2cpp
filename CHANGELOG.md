## Bug Fixes in Review Process

### Fixed
- **Integer parsing**: Enhanced to handle hexadecimal, binary, octal, and C-style suffixes
- **XML element lookup**: Added fallback support for both 'name' and 'n' tag formats
- **Bit field validation**: Improved bounds checking and overlap detection
- **Memory layout**: Fixed register alignment and padding calculation
- **Identifier sanitization**: Enhanced C++ keyword and reserved name handling
- **Error messages**: Made more descriptive and actionable
- **File handling**: Added proper encoding and error handling
- **Comment generation**: Fixed escaping of C++ comment sequences

### Improved
- **Performance**: Single-pass parsing with efficient data structures
- **Error reporting**: More detailed context and suggestions
- **Test coverage**: Added comprehensive edge case testing
- **Documentation**: Enhanced with more examples and explanations
- **Code organization**: Better separation of concerns and modularity

### Edge Cases Handled
- Empty or missing SVD elements
- Invalid XML formatting
- Overlapping register addresses
- Overlapping bit fields
- Invalid register/field names
- Large register sizes (>64 bits)
- Special characters in names
- HTML entities in descriptions
- Missing required elements
- Malformed bit range specifications

## Technical Details

### Architecture
- **Modular design** with separate parsing, validation, and generation phases
- **Type-safe data structures** using Python dataclasses
- **Comprehensive validation** at each parsing stage
- **Efficient memory usage** with streaming XML parsing

### Standards Compliance
- **ARM SVD specification** v1.3 compliance
- **C++11 standard** compatibility
- **POSIX path handling** for cross-platform support
- **UTF-8 encoding** support throughout

### Performance Characteristics
- **Memory efficient**: O(n) memory usage relative to SVD size
- **Fast parsing**: Typically <1s for medium-sized SVD files
- **Scalable**: Handles large SVD files (>10MB) efficiently
- **Minimal dependencies**: Uses only Python standard library
